To test:

Running this program in visual studio should work out of box. It requires no special NuGet packages or otherwise. 

I was able to clone and run the tests on a clean visual studio install. Please let me know if you have any issues running the process and I'll get them fixed ASAP.

Here are the steps I took (after installing a fresh copy of VS on my laptop)
1. Cloned the repository
2. Navigated to the git repo via File Explorer
3. Opened "Grocer.sln"
4. Opened up a UnitTest file (in my case I clicked "CartTests.cs")
5. Right clicked over a test to open up the menu dialog
6. Clicked "Run Tests"
